            <p>To Amir or shall I say to the love of my life,</p>
            <p>They say that you'll never know when loves gonna struck you they say that you will never be safe from it until it just happens. Never really given into that nonsense I always thought that it was some kind of waste, even though deep down, I knew that I really wanted to experience it, least one in my life. But I never thought that was for me, I always thought that I would wind up alone, because I was convinced that I was at times too much and at others not enough. </p>
            <p> You are probably thinking to yourself what is she saying and you would probably find this cheesy but it's our first Valentine's Day together and we are unfortunately spending it apart miles away from each other and I couldn't help, but to think to myself that I needed to do something more, something that probably no one ever did for you and so I thought that maybe website would be great gesture to show you how much you mean to me.</p>
            <p>I just wanted to say that I didn't just find love when you came to my life, but I also found myself. I am constantly growing and maturing with you and unfortunately I have reached a point where losing you would be just as much as hurtful and painful as forgetting how to breathe. </p>
            <p>Having you around is a blessing and I was just so lost without you and now that I have you, I am planning to never let you go. </p>
            <p>I love you, I love you more than anything I ever thought I loved deeply. These few months that we have spent together were amazing and fulfilling and I can't wait for more months and years beside you and here is to many more Valentine's Day after this one.</p>
            <p>Happy Valentine's Day my Love, ðŸ©·</p>
